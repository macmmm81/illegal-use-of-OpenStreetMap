Subject: Snapchat continues to illegally use OSM data

url: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.snapchat.android&hl=en_US&gl=US

Map within app is missing a clearly visible attribution of OpenStreetMap data.

Note that OSM attribution according to the odbl licence must be clearly visible to users, hidden one is not sufficient.

See "reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses, views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced Work aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it is available under this License" in the ODBL licence.

This was reported to Snapchat and Mapbox in 2019 (id 77032) - see https://github.com/matkoniecz/illegal-use-of-OpenStreetMap/blob/master/Snapchat/Snapchat.md

Mapbox replied on 2020-01-13 that Mapbox reminded Snapchat about attribution requirements and that they gave Snapchat deadline. Email contained no specific info about the deadline.

Is Mapbox planning to take some actual action?
